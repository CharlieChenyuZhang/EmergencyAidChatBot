ArchHack Hackathon 2016 Project. Team: Charlie Chenyu Zhang; Yashasvi Rana; Muhammad Tahsin Sharif; Haonan Song.

Our team tackled a problem that, sometimes, when an emergency (e.g. cutting, bee sting) occurs, people may not have enough time to use a normal "Google Search" and browse several pages until they find the emergency treatments for those situations. People, instead, need a piece of clear and straight forward software which can enable them react on those situations right away. Introducing "Emergency Aid ChatBot", your personal emergency aid consultant online. By simply tying keywords to the ChatBot Interface, the Bot itself will provide users step by step instructions so that they can follow and react on the spot.

Upcoming features: 
"CALL 911", enable users to dial 911 from the conversational user interface;
"Image Detection", if people are not sure what key words to type into the ChatBot, they can simply take a picture of the wound. Emergency Aid ChatBot will analyze the photo and provide users the best treatment based on Machine Learning algorithm. 
"Speak it out", users can listen the instructions instead of reading them.
"Voice control", instead of tying to the Bot, user can use their voices to control the Bot.
